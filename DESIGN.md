## High-Level Design
### Components:
- **Frontend**: A responsive chat window with a navbar and integrated FAQs, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express.js server handling API requests and database connections.
- **Database**: MongoDB used for storing chat messages.

### Data Flow:
1. User interacts with the chat window.
2. User's message is sent to the server using an AJAX request.
3. Server processes the message and interacts with the database if necessary.
4. Server responds with the appropriate message or data.
5. The frontend updates the chat history with the server's response.

## Low-Level Design
- **HTML**: Provides the structure for the chat window, including the FAQ section.
- **CSS**: Styles the chat window to be visually appealing and responsive.
- **JavaScript**: Handles user interactions, message sending, and FAQ toggling on the client side.
- **Node.js**: Processes incoming messages and manages the connection to MongoDB.
- **MongoDB**: Stores and retrieves user messages and possibly FAQs for persistent storage.
